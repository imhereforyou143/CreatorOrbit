🏷 App Name & Concept

Name: CreatorOrbit
Tagline: “Autonomous subscriptions for unstoppable creators.”

Built on Massa

Frontend deployed on DeWeb

Subscriptions + trials powered by Autonomous Smart Contracts (ASC)

No bots, no cron jobs, no backend server needed for billing

👥 Roles in the App

We’ll have 2 main roles:

Viewer / Fan / Subscriber → “User”

Creator (someone who uploads paid content)

Same login, but different dashboards and routes.

🧑‍💻 USER POV – How the app feels to a normal user
1. Landing & Onboarding

Routes:

/ → Landing page

/auth/login → Login

/auth/signup → Signup

Flow:

User visits /

Clicks “Connect Wallet” (Massa wallet / Bearby)

Clicks “I’m here to watch content” → user mode

On first signup:

Smart contract creates a UserProfile

Flags them as isNew = true

Sets trialEnd = now + 7 days

🆓 Trial logic for users:

For the first 7 days, the user:

Can access “Trial content” (free content from creators)

No payment required

After 7 days:

Trial is over

To see premium content, user must subscribe to creators

2. Browsing & Viewing Content

Routes:

/explore → list of creators & content

/creator/:handle → creator public page

/content/:id → single content view

User can:

See a grid of creators

Filter by category (tech, music, art, etc.)

Click a creator → see:

Bio

Tiers

3 free posts (trial content)

Locked premium posts (blurred/locked)

Free content rules:

Each creator can mark up to 3 posts as isFreeTrial = true.

Any user can:

View those free posts always

If within 7-day trial → may get extra perks (e.g. limited access to some premium previews)

3. Subscribing to a Creator

From /creator/:handle:

User sees subscription tiers, example:

Tier 1: Supporter – 5 MASSA / month

Tier 2: Super Fan – 15 MASSA / month

Clicks “Subscribe”

Frontend calls smart contract:

subscribe(creatorId, tierId)


Contract stores:

subscriberAddress

creatorAddress

tierId

nextPaymentTime (e.g., now + 30 days)

isActive = true

🧠 After this, Autonomous Smart Contract will:

Charge funds every 30 days

If user has no balance → auto-cancel subscription

4. User Dashboard

Route: /dashboard/user

Tabs inside:

/dashboard/user/overview – active subscriptions, trial status

/dashboard/user/subscriptions – list of creators subscribed

/dashboard/user/billing – payments history (on-chain)

/dashboard/user/settings – profile info

Features user gets:

See:

Active subscriptions

Next billing date

How much they’ve paid in total

Cancel a subscription → calls:

cancelSubscription(subscriptionId)


See trial progress:

“Trial remaining: 3 days”

After trial ends, UI shows “Upgrade to continue watching premium content”

🎨 CREATOR POV – Dashboard & Features
1. Becoming a Creator

Routes:

/creator/onboard → Apply as creator

/dashboard/creator → Creator dashboard

Flow:

User clicks “Become a Creator”

Fills:

Creator name

Username/handle

Bio

Category

Smart contract registerCreator():

Marks isCreator = true

Creates CreatorProfile on-chain

2. Creator Dashboard Layout

Main route: /dashboard/creator
Sub-routes:

/dashboard/creator/overview

Earnings summary

Active subscribers count

Monthly revenue

/dashboard/creator/content

Upload/manage posts

/dashboard/creator/subscribers

List of subscribers

/dashboard/creator/tiers

Define subscription plans

/dashboard/creator/payouts

Claim earnings, see payout history

/dashboard/creator/settings

Profile update, links, etc.

3. Creator Features in Detail
a) Manage Tiers

On /dashboard/creator/tiers:

Add Tier:

Name (e.g., “Supporter”, “Pro”, “VIP”)

Price (MASSA per month)

Benefits text

Optional: hasFreeTrialAccess (yes/no)

Calls smart contract:

createTier(creatorId, name, price, metadataURI)


Stored on-chain: Tier{ id, creatorId, price, perksURI }

b) Upload Content

On /dashboard/creator/content:

Form fields:

Title

Description

Type: post / video / audio / file

Visibility:

FREE_TRIAL (only up to 3 per creator)

SUBSCRIBERS_ONLY

Attached media → stored on IPFS or other decentralized storage

Flow:

Frontend uploads file → IPFS → gets contentCID

Smart contract call:

createContent(creatorId, tierIdRequired, visibility, contentCID)


Rules:

If visibility = FREE_TRIAL:

Check if creator already has 3 free trial contents:

If yes → reject

If no → allow

c) Earnings & Payouts

On /dashboard/creator/payouts:

Smart contract accumulates all subscription payments in CreatorVault.

Creator can click “Withdraw”:

Calls withdrawEarnings() → sends MASSA to creator wallet

Show:

totalEarned

availableToWithdraw

withdrawalHistory

🧠 HOW MASSA SMART CONTRACTS & ASC WORK HERE

We’ll design 3 main contracts:

UserRegistry – profiles (user/creator)

SubscriptionManager – tiers, subscriptions, trials, billing

ContentRegistry – content metadata & access control

And Autonomous logic (ASC) to run billing & cleanups.

1️⃣ UserRegistry (simple)

Stores:

User {
  address: string;
  isCreator: bool;
  isNew: bool;
  trialEndTimestamp: u64; // block time + 7 days
}


On signup:

isNew = true

trialEndTimestamp = now + 7 days

2️⃣ SubscriptionManager

Handles:

Creating tiers

Managing subscriptions

Running periodic billing

Data:

CreatorTier {
  id: u64;
  creator: string;
  pricePerMonth: u64;
  metadataURI: string;
}

Subscription {
  id: u64;
  subscriber: string;
  creator: string;
  tierId: u64;
  isActive: bool;
  nextPaymentTime: u64;
}

🔁 Autonomous Billing (Magic of Massa)

We use deferred calls / ASC like:

scheduleBilling() – called automatically every X blocks.

Inside scheduleBilling():

Loop over subscriptions

If now >= nextPaymentTime:

Try to charge subscriber:

If subscriber sent funds / has deposit balance:

Transfer MASSA to creator vault

Update nextPaymentTime = now + 30 days

Else:

Set isActive = false (auto-cancel)

No cron jobs. No bot.
Pure smart contract logic running autonomously.

3️⃣ ContentRegistry

Stores:

Content {
  id: u64;
  creator: string;
  tierIdRequired: u64 | 0; // 0 if free trial
  visibility: "FREE_TRIAL" | "SUBSCRIBERS_ONLY";
  contentCID: string; // IPFS hash
}


When frontend loads /content/:id:

Calls canViewContent(userAddress, contentId) on-chain:

If visibility == FREE_TRIAL → allow

Else if user has active subscription to this creator & tier → allow

Else → deny

Then frontend:

If canView = true → fetch from IPFS & show

If false → show “Subscribe to unlock”

🏗 APP ARCHITECTURE (High Level)
Frontend (DeWeb)

Framework: React / Next.js / Vite + React

Hosted fully on Massa DeWeb

Talks to smart contracts via Massa SDK

Main routes:

/ → Landing

/auth/login / /auth/signup

/explore

/creator/:handle

/content/:id

/dashboard/user/*

/dashboard/creator/*

Backend

❌ No traditional backend required.
✅ All core logic lives in smart contracts.

You might optionally add:

An indexer / small off-chain service to speed up searches (/explore), but not required for the hackathon demo.

Smart Contracts (on Massa)

Language: AssemblyScript (via Massa Ready template)

Key features:

Autonomous billing

On-chain access control

Trials & roles

DeWeb integration (storing URLs, CIDs)

🔄 COMPLETE USER WORKFLOW SUMMARY
New user:

Visit /

Connect wallet

Account created in UserRegistry with 7-day trial

Browse /explore

Open creator/:handle, watch free + trial content

After trial or anytime:

Click Subscribe → pay → SubscriptionManager stores sub

Periodic billing handled by ASC

They manage subs in /dashboard/user

New creator:

Normal user → click “Become a Creator”
